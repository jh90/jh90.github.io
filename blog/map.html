      The essential function of the .map method called on an enumerator is to manipulate or respond to the value of each element in the series (array, hash, numberline) according to a specified code block, pushing each returned value to a new array which the method as a whole returns. This might allow me, for example, to take a list of people's names and add an "!" to all those who are my friends, and a "?" to all those I'm not sure I remember meeting - perhaps based on their (each element's) presence in a list of my friends or absence in a list of names I know, eg. from a conference or job fair. To use it, call enum.map{|n| block}, where 'enum' might be 2..11, array.each, etc., 'n' holds the element or number currently being iterated over (as might follow a 'do' statement), and 'block' is whatever code you wish to be executed on 'n'.
