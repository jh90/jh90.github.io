      Version control, in coding and other activities that involve constant revision, extension, and error correction, version control preserves the workflow that has produced the current version of our documents. This gives us the power of rewinding changes to anywhere in a history of save points – something most of us wish was occasionally available in life. This increases the robustness of the development process, particularly when multiple contributors are making changes to the same set of documents. It also improves efficiency, as every failure can be traced back to its point of origin, and if necessary fixed by simply starting again from before the change rather than hunting down and identifying any and all errors. Git provides a straightforward way to group related pieces of code (repos), distribute and sync copies of it (cloning, remotes), and create a tracked series of local copies (branches) in which to sandbox changes to software. Its fullest functionality is available when used in conjunction with GitHub, an opensource 'metarepository' that facilitates and standardizes the distributed collaboration that git makes possible.
